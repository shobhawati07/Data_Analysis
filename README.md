FAILED ORDER ANALYSIS

INTRODUCTION: Gett, previously known as GetTaxi, is an Israeli-developed technology platform solely focused on corporate Ground Transportation Management (GTM). They have an application where clients can order taxis, and drivers can accept their rides (offers).

PROBLEM STATEMENT: when the client clicks the Order button in the application, the matching system searches for the most relevant drivers and offers them the order. In this task, we would like to investigate some matching metrics for orders that did not completed successfully, i.e., the customer didn't end up getting a car.That is task is to get INSIGHTS FROM FAILED ORDER ,so that can prevent from order to failed.
